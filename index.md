### PROJECT 1: 

## [Analyze Customer Lifetime Value and Marketing Performance with Excel and Power BI](/sample_page)
This is one of my freelance projects that historical datasets provided in CSV for a Lifetime Value of customers in NeoBank in the United Kingdom.
The Customer's Lifetime Value was calculated in Excel using the formula:  

The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) can be calculated using the following formula:

<p style="text-align: center"> $CLV = \frac{\sum (P_i \ times R_i)}{Churn Rate}$ </p>

<br>
Where:
- \( P_i \) is the profit generated from the customer in the i-th period,
- \( R_i \) is the retention rate for the i-th period,
- Churn Rate is the rate at which customers stop subscribing or purchasing.
This formula represents the total present value of the future cash flows generated by a customer over their entire relationship with a business (Last Column)
