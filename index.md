### PROJECT 1: 

## [Analyze Customer Lifetime Value and Marketing Performance with Excel and Power BI](/sample_page)
This is one of my freelance projects that historical datasets provided in CSV for a Lifetime Value of customers in NeoBank in the United Kingdom.
The Customer's Lifetime Value was calculated in Excel using the formula:  

The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ CLV = \frac{{\sum (P_i \times R_i)}}{Churn Rate} \]

Where:
- \( P_i \) is the profit generated from the customer in the i-th period,
- \( R_i \) is the retention rate for the i-th period,
- Churn Rate is the rate at which customers stop subscribing or purchasing.

This formula represents the total present value of the future cash flows generated by a customer over their entire relationship with a business.
