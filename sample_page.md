## Analyze Customer Lifetime Value and Marketing Performance with Excel and Power BI

**Project description:** This is one of my freelance projects that historical datasets provided in CSV for a Lifetime Value of customers in NeoBank in the United Kingdom. 4 CSV files are being joined together. Two of them are used for capturing Customers' Lifetime Value and the other 2 for Marketing Performance. CLV is extremely important for any business, especially when it comes to banking industry.

### 1. Developing Customer Lifetime Value formula in Excel
The Customer's Lifetime Value was calculated in Excel using the formula:  

The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) can be calculated using the following formula:

<p style="text-align: center"> $CLV = \frac{\sum (P_i \ times R_i)}{Churn Rate}$ </p>

<br>
Where:
- \( P_i \) is the profit generated from the customer in the i-th period,
- \( R_i \) is the retention rate for the i-th period,
- Churn Rate is the rate at which customers stop subscribing or purchasing.
This formula represents the total present value of the future cash flows generated by a customer over their entire relationship with a business (Last Column)

### b. Advises to our Performance Marketing Team:

  ### Time-Optimized Campaigns:
  Given that conversions are highest starting at 9 AM and start decreasing at 7 PM, consider optimizing your marketing campaigns to align with these peak conversion hours. Schedule important promotions, advertisements, or targeted communications during this time frame to maximize impact.
  
  ### After-Hours Account Creation:
  Since users tend to create accounts after work hours, consider tailoring communication strategies to engage with users during this time. Send relevant content, promotions, or account activation messages during the evening hours to increase user engagement and retention.
  
  ### Geographic Targeting:
  Focus marketing efforts on users in Australia, the United Kingdom, and South America, as they exhibit the highest Average Lifetime Value. Tailor campaigns to these regions to better resonate with their preferences and behaviors.
  
  ### Channel Optimization:
  Continue to prioritize and optimize Paid Social and SEO channels, as they contribute significantly to the Total Lifetime Value. For Paid Social, consider refining targeting parameters, ad creatives, or timing to enhance its efficiency.
  
  ### Money Transfer Emphasis:
  Since the majority of customers prefer Money Transfers, continue emphasizing this service in marketing materials. Highlight its benefits, ease of use, and any promotions or features that set it apart from competitors.
  
  ### Target the 26-34 Age Group:
  Allocate marketing resources toward the age group of 26-34, as they show the highest Total Lifetime Value. Craft messages and promotions that resonate with the preferences and needs of users in this age range.
  
  ### Optimize for SEO and Strategic Partnerships:
  Given the highest average Lifetime Value for SEO and Strategic Partnerships, continue investing in and optimizing strategies for these channels. Identify successful tactics and replicate them, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation.
  
  ### User Engagement Strategies:
  Develop user engagement strategies that cater to the after-work hours. This could include targeted emails, app notifications, or social media posts designed to capture user attention during this timeframe.

#### c. Further Analysis Needed and Future Considerations for the Dataset:
- User Segmentation: Further segment users based on additional factors such as income levels, occupation, or device usage. This can provide more nuanced insights into the characteristics of high-value users and inform targeted marketing strategies.
- Customer Feedback Analysis: If available, analyze customer feedback or support tickets to understand user sentiments, pain points, and areas of satisfaction. This qualitative data can complement quantitative insights and help prioritize improvements.
